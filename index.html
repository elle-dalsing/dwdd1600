        <h1>Declaration of Independence</h1>
        <h2>What does it say?</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Declaration of Independence</strong> states the principles on which our government, and our identity as <em>Americans</em>, are based. Unlike the other founding documents, the Declaration of Independence is not legally binding, but it is powerful. Abraham Lincoln called it “a rebuke and a stumbling-block to tyranny and oppression.” It continues to inspire people around the world to fight for freedom and equality.</p>

        <h2>Why did they write it?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.<li>
            <li>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</li>    
            <li>He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.</li>
