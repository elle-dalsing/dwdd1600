<h2>Printed Works</h2>

<body>
    <p>My printed works emphasize the tactile and timeless nature of design, combining thoughtful composition with striking visuals. From editorial layouts to posters and branding materials, I focus on typography, color, and structure to create pieces that are both engaging and functional. Each design is crafted with attention to detail, ensuring clarity and impact in a physical format. Through print, I explore how design can enhance storytelling and create a lasting impression.</p>
